# Assignment 3

## Performance

The result that I obtained from assignment 3 was {xx}.

## Premise

From the assignment specification, the the premise of this assignment was:

> The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your skills and ability in fundamental process management and communication concepts, and to further develop your C programming skills with a moderately complex program.
>
> You are to create a program called testuqwordiply that creates and manages communicating collections of processes that test a uqwordiply program (from assignment one) according to a job specification file that lists tests to be run. For various test cases, your program will run both a test version of uqwordiply and the assignment one solution (available as demo-uqwordiply) and compare their standard outputs, standard errors and exit statuses and report the results. You will be provided with (and must use) a program named uqcmp that will compare the input arriving on two file descriptors. The assignment will also test your ability to code to a programming style guide and to use a revision control system appropriately.
