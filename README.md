# CSSE2310

My assessment documents from [CSSE2310 (Computer Systems Principles and Programming)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=CSSE2310), taken in semester 1, 2023.

The course had four assignments, each with summaries included in their respective folders, focussed around:
1. General C programming and file I/O.
2. Understanding debugging (specifically with GDB).
3. Forking, piping and program execution.
4. Network programming and multithreading.

I have also included a $\LaTeX$ notebook that served as my revision / exam notes.
