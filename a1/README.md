## Premise

From the assignment specification, the the premise of this assignment was:

> The goal of this assignment is to give you practice at C programming. You will be building on this ability in the remainder of the course (and subsequent programming assignments will be more difficult than this one). You are to create a program (called uqwordiply) which allows users to play the Wordiply game (wordiply.com). More details are provided below but you may wish to play the game to gain a practical understanding of how it operates. The assignment will also test your ability to code to a particular programming style guide, and to use a revision control system appropriately.
