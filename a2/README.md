# Assignment 2

## Performance

The result that I obtained from assignment 2 was 96% (48 / 50).

## Premise

From the assignment specification, the the premise of this assignment was:

> The goal of this assignment is to ensure you have gained familiarity and skills with both the C programming language and using a debugger (such as gdb(1)) to examine various characteristics of running programs. These will be essential skills in other assignments for this course. For this assignment you will be given an executable program (the “bomb”) which you have to “defuse” by entering the correct defusing phrases into the program for each of the 10 bomb phases.
